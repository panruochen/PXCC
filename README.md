## CODELESS

CODELESS is designed to remove conditional blocks.

CODELESS is usually used with the y-Make script during compilation process.
It feteches macro definitions from command lines and header files, then
cleans up the source code. That should give you a clear screen while
reading source code.

 * linux-3.6
 * linux-2.6.27.29

More prjects are under tests.
