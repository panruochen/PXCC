## YCPP - A C/C++ source code preprocessor

YCPP is designed to remove conditional blocks.

YCPP is usually used with the y-Make script during compilation process.
It feteches macros from the command line and header files, and then
cleans up the source code. That should give you a clear screen while
reading source code.

Until now, YCPP works on the following projects:
 * linux-3.6
 * linux-2.6.27.29
 * llvm-3.5.0

More prjects are under tests.
